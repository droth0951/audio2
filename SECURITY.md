# Security Recommendations

## Critical Security Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Hardcoded AssemblyAI API key was exposed in `App.js`
**Status:** FIXED - API key removed and replaced with proxy server calls

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **Revoke the Exposed API Key** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Go to your AssemblyAI account dashboard
- Revoke the API key: `b9399f83f15a4c65a0a00f3c9876f2c9`
- Generate a new API key for your proxy server

### 2. **Set Environment Variable on Railway**
- Add the new API key as an environment variable on your Railway deployment:
  ```
  ASSEMBLY_AI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
  ```

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well
1. **Proxy Server Pattern**: Your proxy server correctly uses environment variables
2. **No Client-Side API Keys**: The app now uses the proxy server instead of direct API calls
3. **Proper .gitignore**: Environment files are properly excluded

### üîí Security Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Always use environment variables for API keys
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use different API keys for development and production

2. **API Key Rotation**
   - Regularly rotate your API keys
   - Monitor API usage for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for unusual usage patterns

3. **Code Review**
   - Add security checks to your code review process
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent accidental commits
   - Consider using pre-commit hooks

4. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor your AssemblyAI usage dashboard
   - Set up alerts for high usage or errors
   - Log API calls for debugging (without sensitive data)

## Current Architecture (Secure)

```
Mobile App ‚Üí Proxy Server ‚Üí AssemblyAI API
                ‚Üì
         Environment Variable
         (ASSEMBLY_AI_API_KEY)
```

## Files Modified
- `App.js`: Removed hardcoded API key, now uses proxy server
- `audio-trimmer-server/api/transcribe.js`: Uses environment variable ‚úÖ
- `audio-trimmer-server/api/transcribe-status.js`: Uses environment variable ‚úÖ

## Next Steps
1. Revoke the exposed API key immediately
2. Generate a new API key
3. Set the new key as an environment variable on Railway
4. Test the application to ensure everything works
5. Consider implementing API key rotation schedule
