## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Environment

### Current Tech Stack:
- **Framework:** React Native with Expo SDK 53
- **Audio:** expo-av (working perfectly)
- **Icons:** @expo/vector-icons (MaterialCommunityIcons)
- **Design:** LinearGradient, Claude color scheme
- **Video:** expo-media-library, expo-file-system, react-native-view-shot

### Working Dependencies:
```bash
# Currently installed and working:
expo-media-library
expo-file-system  
react-native-view-shot
expo-av
expo-linear-gradient
@expo/vector-icons
```

### For Stage 2B (when ready):
```bash
# For full video generation:
ffmpeg-kit-react-native  # Modern replacement for deprecated react-native-ffmpeg
# OR
expo-av (extended capabilities)
```

---

## üì± Current App State

### What Works Perfectly:
1. **Episode browsing** - Loads The Town podcast feed
2. **Audio playback** - Full player with scrubbing, skip controls
3. **Clip selection** - Set start/end points up to 4 minutes
4. **Preview mode** - Dedicated timeline for clip preview
5. **Video frame generation** - Creates perfect wireframe-matching frames
6. **Photos export** - Saves to device with album organization

### User Flow (Tested & Working):
1. Browse episodes ‚Üí Select episode ‚Üí Audio loads
2. Play/scrub to find interesting moment
3. Tap "Start" to set clip beginning
4. Continue playing, tap "End" to set clip end  
5. Tap "Save Clip" ‚Üí Opens VideoCreationModal
6. Choose 9:16 or 1:1 format
7. Tap "Generate Video Frame" ‚Üí Watch progress
8. Preview generated frame ‚Üí Tap "Save to Photos"

## üîß Known Technical Decisions

### Stage 1 Choices:
- Hardcoded RSS feed (The Town) for simplicity
- Single-file architecture in App.js for rapid development
- expo-av chosen over alternatives for reliability

### Stage 2A Choices:
- react-native-view-shot for frame capture (works reliably)
- PNG export over MP4 for immediate working solution
- Modal-based UI for professional feel
- Avoided complex video libraries due to dependency conflicts

### Stage 2B Considerations:
- ffmpeg-kit-react-native preferred over deprecated alternatives
- May need background processing for longer clips
- File size optimization will be important
- Consider progressive enhancement approach

## üí° Notes for Next Session

### Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# Start development
npx expo start

# If dependency issues
npx expo install expo-media-library expo-file-system react-native-view-shot
```

### Testing Workflow:
1. Select episode from The Town feed
2. Play and set 4-minute clip points
3. Generate video frame in both aspect ratios
4. Verify Photos app saves work correctly

### Key Implementation Files to Review:
- VideoCreationModal.js (lines 100-200 contain frame generation logic)
- App.js handleSetClipPoint function (now supports 4-minute clips)
