### Caption Timing Issues
If captions show wrong text or don't sync with audio:
1. **Check the [Utterance Timing Guide](docs/utterance_timing_guide.md)** - The most common cause of timing problems
2. **Review [Caption Sync Debugging](docs/caption_sync_debugging.md)** - Step-by-step debugging process
3. **Verify [Time Units Guide](docs/time_units_guide.md)** - Understanding how timing works

### Screen Recording Issues
If screen recordings show blank captions:
- Check z-index values for caption components
- Verify captions are rendered in RecordingView component
- Ensure proper audio session configuration
